## 🎯 Overview

This project provides a comprehensive comparative analysis of **Neuroevolution (NEAT)** and **Reinforcement Learning (DQN)** approaches for maze navigation with deliberately misleading paths. The focus is on understanding how these two fundamentally different AI paradigms:

- **React** to challenging environments
- **Decide** between competing options
- **Adapt** their strategies over time

### Why This Matters

Understanding how different AI approaches handle deception and misleading information is crucial for:
- Building robust AI systems
- Advancing toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
- Understanding the strengths and limitations of different learning paradigms
- Developing hybrid approaches that combine the best of both worlds

## 🔬 Methodology

### Maze Environment

The custom maze environment includes:

- **Empty Cells (0)**: Navigable space
- **Walls (1)**: Impassable obstacles
- **Goal (2)**: Target destination (+100 reward)
- **Traps (3)**: Dangerous cells (-10 reward)
- **Misleading Paths (4)**: Seemingly good but suboptimal (+0.5 reward)

### NEAT Implementation

**Key Parameters:**
- Population size: 150
- Fitness criterion: Maximum
- Activation functions: tanh, relu, sigmoid
- Connection weights: [-30, 30]
- Mutation rates: 0.7 (bias), 0.8 (weight)

**Fitness Function:**
```python
if reached_goal:
    fitness = 100 + (500 - steps)  # Bonus for speed
else:
    distance_fitness = (1 - final_distance / max_distance) * 50
    exploration_bonus = unique_cells_visited * 0.5
    fitness = distance_fitness + exploration_bonus + total_reward
```

### DQN Implementation

**Network Architecture:**
- Input: 12 features (position + local view)
- Hidden layers: [128, 64] with ReLU + Dropout(0.1)
- Output: 4 actions (up, right, down, left)

**Hyperparameters:**
- Learning rate: 0.001
- Discount factor (γ): 0.99
- Epsilon: 1.0 → 0.01 (decay: 0.995)
- Batch size: 64
- Replay buffer: 10,000
- Target network update: Every 10 episodes

**Reward Shaping:**
```python
reward = base_reward + distance_reward + exploration_reward + time_penalty
```

## 📖 FAQ

### Q: Which method should I use for my problem?

**A**: It depends on your requirements:
- Use **NEAT** if you need diverse solutions, have limited data, or want interpretable networks
- Use **DQN** if you have lots of training time, need consistency, or require precise control

### Q: How long does training take?

**A**: 
- NEAT: ~30 minutes for 50 generations (CPU)
- DQN: ~45 minutes for 500 episodes (CPU), ~15 minutes (GPU)

### Q: Can I use this for real robotics?

**A**: The simulation is a good starting point, but real-world deployment requires:
- Sim-to-real transfer techniques
- Robust sensor processing
- Safety constraints
- Domain randomization

### Q: How do I create custom mazes?

**A**: See [Environment Design Guide](docs/environment_guide.md) or use the maze editor:
```python
from env.maze_env import MazeEnv
env = MazeEnv()
env.save_maze('custom.json')
```

### Q: Can I use other RL algorithms?

**A**: Yes! The environment is Gymnasium-compatible. Try:
- PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)
- A3C (Asynchronous Actor-Critic)
- SAC (Soft Actor-Critic)
- TD3 (Twin Delayed DDPG)

### Q: How do I reproduce the paper results?

**A**: Run the complete pipeline:
```bash
bash scripts/reproduce_results.sh
